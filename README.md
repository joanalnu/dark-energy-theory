# dark-energy-theory

Learning about different models and parametrisations of dark energy and its evolution. My ultimate goal is to use multi-messenger observations to constrain phenomenological observations coming from these models and advance in our understanding of the cosmic acceleration.

Initial work developed at joanalnu/oab-inaf.

This is my attempt to learn about the fundaments of cosmological and dark energy models particularly. You can find multi-messenger observational cosmology work at [joanalnu/multi-messenger-cosmology](https://github.com/joanalnu/multi-messenger-cosmology).
