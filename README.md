# dark-energy-theory

Learning about different models and parametrisations of dark energy and its evolution. My ultimate goal is to use multi-messenger observations to constrain phenomenological observations coming from these models and advance in our understanding of the cosmic acceleration.

Initial work developed at joanalnu/oab-inaf.

This is my attempt to learn about the fundaments of cosmological and dark energy models particularly. You can find multi-messenger observational cosmology work at [joanalnu/multi-messenger-cosmology](https://github.com/joanalnu/multi-messenger-cosmology).


## Repository Structure
1. `code/brane_theory`: comparing LCDM scale factor and distances evolutions with brane theory altered friedmann equations
2. `code/LCDM`: inspired from [gcanasherrera/calculadoracosmologica](https://github.com/gcanasherrera/calculadoracosmologica), I decoded her project from C/C++ to Python as a coding exercise.
3. `code/simulations`: evolution of the hubble parameter tinkering with the friedman equation and other parameters using astropy

* `lit-review`: code for plotting of main cosmological parameters (e.g. $H_0$, $\Omega_m$, $\Omega_{DE}$) from literature data $\implies$ Hubble Tension :).
* `simulations`: code from previous project, cosmological simulatiosn using `astropy` methods.
